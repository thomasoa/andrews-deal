Changes in Deal 3.0.5

   * Fixed a bug - Deal 3.0.4 failed to recognize "-" as void
   in -S, -E, -N, -W options, as well as in "north is " commands.

     -----

Changes in Deal 3.0.4

   * Update doc examples to match ex/ subdirectory.

   * Deleted util.c and util.h from distribution.

     -----

Changes in Deal 3.0.3

  * Added GNU General Public License copyright to most files, and full
  GPL text to release.

  * Altered deal.c to improve performance of reset_deal() routine.
  Improved overall performance of 10%.

  * Re-implemented in Tcl the broken undocumented old procedures,
   intersectclass, negateclass, and joinclass.  This lets you create
   new shape classes from old shape classes using standard boolean
   functions.  Old code removed from dist.c, new code added to deal.tcl .

  * Deleted some unused code in deal.tcl which was left from early
   efforts at the smart stacking routines.

  * Updated the documentation

     -----
Changes in Deal 3.0.2

  * Fixed a bug in the smartstack methods.

  * Altered zip builds to put files in deal302 directory (rather than
   deal3.0.2)

  * Polished the HTML docs (in docs/html directory.)

  * Many, many improved error messages when commands are misused

  * Cleaned up some code

  * Made dist.c use more Tcl_Obj pointers rather than strings - makes for
   faster compiles of shape classes.  (I can't believe I left those
   sprintf calls for so long. :-)

  * Fixed some of the examples which called deal::stack_hand, a non-existant
   procedure.

Changes in Deal 3.0.1

The changes for Deal 3.0.1 (from Deal 3.0 beta 11) were made essentially
for two reasons:

 (1) To finish the Deal 3.0 release - e.g., added documentation.
 (2) To add features needed for the "smartstack" routines.

  * Include HTML docs in docs/html directory.

  * Most library files in release moved to the lib directory

  * Added "smartstack" input class for fast building of hands which fit
  specific patterns
  
  * Added "stacked" procedure to find out the current state of the
  deck-stacking. Returns the list of cards stacked to the named hand.

  * Altered stacking methods.  Added procedures "deck_stack_cards," 
  "deck_stack_hand", "stack_cards," and "stack_hand."  By default,
  "stack_hand" and "stack_cards" just call the "deck_" procedures,
  but the idea is that "stack_cards" and "stack_hands" can be
  overridden. Now when you call "south is AJ4 KJ54 9643 72" it in
  turn calls "stack_hand south AJ4 KJ54 9643 72." Similarly,
  "south gets ..." calls "stack_cards," although there the transformation
  is somewhat different.
  
  * Added "list" subcommand to shape classes.  e.g.,

	  shapeclass hasVoid { expr {$s*$h*$d*$c==0} }

	  foreach shape [hasVoid list] {
		...
	  }

  * Added "shape" subcommand to the shape classes and functions, e.g.,

	  shapefunc foo { ... }

	  foo shape {4 2 4 3}

    So:

	  foo north

    Is the same as:

	  foo shape [north shape]

  * Added the "holding" utility procedure, with subcommands length,
    disjoint, ...

	  holding length AKxxx   =>    5
	  holding disjoint AKJ4 QT94  => 0    [ false ]
  
New to Deal 3.0:

  * Fast holding procedures definable with holdingProc.

  * GIB interfaces (gib::directory, gib::tricks, parscore)

  * Bridge utility routines - lho, rho, partner, score

  * Input format extensibility

  * Uses features of faster versions of Tcl (Tcl 8.x)
