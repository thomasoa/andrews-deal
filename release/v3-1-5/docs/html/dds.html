<h1>Double Dummy Solver</h1>
<p>Deal now has a built-in double dummy solver, as provided by <a href="http://web.telia.com/~u07502278/">Bo Haglund.</a>
<p>The commands for accessing the double dummy solver is <a href="commands.html#dds">documented here.</a>
<p>Deal currently contains the code for DDS 1.1.8.
<p>While DDS is fairly fast most of the time, on some deals, it can take a long time.  In particular, when there are lots
of voids, can take several minutes to analyze the board.
<p>For example, in this deal:
<pre>
          S: ---
          H: QT97
          D: AJ432
          C: K865
 S: K865           S: QT97
 H: ---            H: AJ432
 D: QT97           D: K865
 C: AJ432          C: ---
          S: AJ432
          H: K865
          D: ---
          C: QT97
</pre>
<p>DDS takes more than 20 minutes to analyze South declaring Notrump.
