<h1>Optimizing Dealing - Some Ideas</h1>
<hr>
<p>
After doing some profiling, I found 'deal' spends most of its time
in the random number generator.  This is apparently a problem
other people have encountered, and at least one of the publicly
available dealers actually cheats around this somewhat by using
a bad methodology.
<p>
To stay out of the random number generator as much as possible,
I made improvements so that 'deal' only deals cards to a hand
when information is requested about that hand.
<p>
For example, with the script:
<pre class="codesample">
main {
    #west has 15-17 HCP and east has a 5-card heart suit
    reject unless {[balanced west]}                     # line A
    set whcp [hcp west]                          
    reject if {$whcp&gt;17} {$whcp&lt;15}
    accept if {[hearts east]>=5}                        # line B
}
</pre>
Each time through the main loop, 'deal' starts with no cards dealt.
When it reaches line (A), a question is asked about the west hand.
No cards have been dealt yet, so 'deal' parcels out 13 random cards
to west (requiring 13 calls to the random number generator.)
'Deal' then checks whether the hand is in fact balanced, and if not,
it rejects the hand.
<p>
If the hand is balanced, 'deal' computes the HCP, rejecting the deal
if west isn't between 15 and 17 HCP.   Only at line (B) do we request
that east have 5 or more hearts, at which point "deal" gives 13 cards
to east and then checks the conditional.  If the hand is accepted,
the rest of the deal is completed.
<p>
Under this implementation, you can often come close to tripling the speed of
complex queries.
<p>
Other optimizations are possible.
<p>
Let's say you want to deal hands where south has a solid seven card
or longer minor suit and no side aces or kings, and north holds: 
<span class="code">"S: AK H: K52 D: 98765 C: 962"</span>.  To do this simulation
now, we place north's card, and then deal the rest of south's cards,
rejecting deals which don't satisfy our conditions. This might take a while.
<p>
Theoretically, we could do this much faster by picking a shape for south
using relative probabilities, and deal him cards which fit that shape.
So, for instance, the number of ways to assign random cards to north 
to give north a 3-2-7-1 shape is 
(11 choose 3) * (10 choose 2) * (8 choose 7) * (10 choose 1)=594000,
while the number of ways for him to have 3-2-1-7 shape is (11 choose 3) *
(10 choose 2) * (8 choose 1) * (10 choose 7)=7128000.
<p>
It should come as no surprise that it is more likely that south has seven clubs
than that south has seven diamonds, given north's shape.
<p>
Since there are only 560 total possible shapes without <em>any</em>
restrictions, we can certainly run through all possible shapes and determine
their relative odds.  Then we can pick one of these possible shapes
randomly, with the proper probability distributions, and assign cards at
random, suit by suit, to bring the south hand to the proper shape.  At this
point, we check to determine that the other properties are met.
<p>
This would certainly greatly improve the performance in certain "rare
hand" situations.  It's not clear how much it could improve more
general randomizations.  What if we simply need north to be balanced?
Or for north to have a 5-card major?  Would this sort of optimization
improve things?
<p>
Also, this methodology makes it much harder to *prove* that the hand
generator is correct.  The code to handle the probability computations
has to be impeccable.
<p>
Lastly, I can't see any way to automatically get the hand shape information
needed for such optimizations; if I controlled the parser, I might be
able to intelligently glean the information from the specification, but
since I've chosen Tcl as my scripting language, I'm somewhat stuck in
that regard.  The user will almost certainly have to provide the 
optimization request directly.
<p>
<h2> Why optimize? </h2>
There is a logical argument against such optimizations, on the other hand.
What are we trying to learn if we are looking at a sample of one in a million
hands?  Let's say you play gambling 3NT, and partner opens 3NT with you holding
<span class="code">S: Axxx H: KQx D: Q C: xxxxx</span>.
If we try to simulate this, assuming partner has
7+ solid clubs and no side aces, we might not get a proper hand for a
very long time.  On the
other hand, the number of possible hands where partner has "fudged" his
call with AKJTxxxx of diamonds or with only six clubs is considerably higher.
In simulations where hands are not being found after tens of thousands of tries,
it is often right to loosen the parameters.
<p>
On the other hand, if you are trying to settle an argument like, "Well, if
you had your bid, that would have been a good slam," then the tighter
parameters might be right, in which case optimizations might be necessary.
