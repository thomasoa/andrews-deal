<title>Deal 3.1 - GIB interfaces</title>

<div class="toplevel">
<h1>Deal 3.1 - GIB interfaces</h1>

The file <span class="code">lib/gib.tcl</span> defines a simple interface for accessing
the GIB double-dummy solver.
<p>
<span class="alert">This code only works on Windows.</span>

<h2><span class="code">gib::directory</span></h2>
This command tells Deal where GIB is installed.  If GIB is installed
in the standard Windows directory,
<span class="code">C:\Program Files\GIB</span>,
then you don't need to call this.  But if it is installed elsewhere,
you need to call this procedure:
<pre class="codesample">
source lib/gib.tcl

gib::directory "c:/Games/GIB"
</pre>
Note that Tcl uses forward-slash characters, <span
class="code">/</span> to seperate directory patchs.
<p>
You can also just edit gib.tcl to permanently change the default.
<p>
Another thing you might want to change is where the gib library
places temporary files.  Currently, gib.tcl has the directory
<span class="code">C:\temp</span> hard-coded for the temporary files.  If you
don't have such a directory, and don't want to create one, then you'll
need to edit gib.tcl .

<h2><span class="code">gib::tricks</span></h2>

The procedure <span class="code">gib::tricks</span> returns the number of tricks
a hand can make in a specific denomination (suit or notrump.)
For example:
<pre class="codesample">
source lib/gib.tcl

main {

  accept if {[gib::tricks south notrump]>=12}

}
</pre>

finds deals where south can make 12 or more tricks in notrump,
double-dummy.
<p>
This is going to be slow - each call to gib::tricks can take
over a second - so you might try to put some additional
conditions:
<pre class="codesample">
source lib/gib.tcl

main {

  reject if {[hcp north]+[hcp south]<26}

  accept if {[gib::tricks south notrump]>=12}

}
</pre>
That might miss the occasional freakish slam, but it will be considerably
faster.

<p>
The <span class="code">gib::tricks</span> procedure caches values,
so that multiple calls with the same parameters on the same deal
result in quick turn-around.
<p>
This is useful if we are using the <span class="code">parscore</span>
in our query, or if we use the output format, <span class="code">gibpar</span>,
discussed later.

<!--
<h2><span class="code">gib::holdingLeads</span></h2>
This procedure returns a list of double-dummy best leads that opening 
leader can make:
<pre class="codesample">
% gib::holdingLeads south spades 
SA DQ D4
</pre>
This returns the best lead(s) for west when <em>south</em> declares
spades.
<p>
Only one card from equivalents will be listed, so if you hold
<span class="code">KQJT</span> in spades, at most SK will be listed in
the results.
<p>
<font size="-1">
The plan for the Deal 3.1 final release is to rename this function
"bestPlay" and allow you to include previous play in the deal:
<pre>
        % gib::bestPlay south spades SA S3 ... 
</pre>
The extra arguments will be the list of cards already played.
<p>
One last problem - GIB's double dummy solver uses "SA" and "H4"
order, while Deal uses "AS" and "4D."  This might not be too big
a deal.
</font>
-->
<h2><span class="code">parscore</span></h2>

This routine determines the double-dummy par score for a deal.  Because
it calls gib::tricks 20 times - once for each declarer and denomination - it
can take 20 seconds or more per deal.  Not good for huge batches.
<p>
Parscore takes as input the declarer and vulnerability:
<pre class="codesample">
set result [parscore north NS]
set contract [lindex $result 0]
set declarer [lindex $result 1]
set score    [lindex $result 2]
set tricks   [lindex $result 3]
set auction  [lindex $result 4]
</pre>
Vulnerability can be one of <span class="code">None</span>, <span class="code">NS</span>, <span class="code">EW</span>,
or <span class="code">All</span>.
<p>
The result returned is fairly complex - it consists of a list of elements.
<ul>
<li> The first element is a contract, in the form "2 spades doubled" or "2 spades." [ Double-dummy par scores are, of course, never redoubled. ]
<li> The second element is the declarer.
<li> The third element is the score
<li> The fourth element is the number of tricks declarer can take.
<li> The fifth is a stupid auction to get to the contract.  If north is dealer
and east is declarer in the double-dummy par contract of 4 clubs doubled,
the auction will be "Pass 4C X Pass Pass Pass".  Not very inspired, but
needed for the <span class="code">gibpar</span> application, below.
</ul>

<span style="font-size: small">[Why do we need to know who is dealer?  Suppose north <em>and</em> east are
the only ones who can make 1NT, and that no higher contracts make.  Then
double-dummy par is 1NT by east if east is dealer, while it is 1NT by north
if anybody else is dealer.]</span>

<h2>The <span class="code">gibpar</span> format</h2>

As soon as I got GIB, I wanted to use Deal to generate PBN files for
GIB to use in play.  It was trickier than I thought - GIB apparently
wants a *score* in the PBN file.  This was why I created the
<span class="code">parscore</span> command above - so that I could write out a PBN
file with a score which was objective, rather than random.
<p>
This format is used like any other format:
<pre class="codesample">
C:\Deal30> deal -i format/gibpar 36 > myfile.pbn
</pre>

As with any other Deal format, <span class="code">format/gibpar</span> can be used with filters:

<pre class="codesample">
C:\Deal30> deal -i format/gibpar -i ex/1.tcl > myfile.pbn
</pre>

Once you've generated this PBN file, you can load it into GIB via the
"Load Saved Deal" command.
<p>
Competing against double-dummy par is grueling work - it's essentially
playing a team game where everybody at the other table is an
infallible psychic - both your "opponents" and your teammates.
That means that any swings are due to errors at your table
and/or luck. They will always bid that making 15% grand at the
other table, for example.
