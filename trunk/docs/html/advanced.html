<h2><a name="vector">Vector additive functions</a></h2>

In the <a href="quickstart.html">Introductory Tutorial</a>, we mentioned
three functions which we called "additive functions."  They were <span class="code">
hcp</span>, <span class="code">controls</span>, and <span class="code">losers</span>.  We called them additive
because we could compute them for a single suit holding in a hand or
across the entire hand by summing over all the suits.
<p>
In this section, we will show how a user can create a large class
of fast additive functions, and show how they can be used.
<p>
The most common additive function is <span class="code">hcp</span>.  How is it
computed?  Given a suit holding, we count 4 for the ace, 3 for
the king, 2 for the queen, and 1 for the jack.  Here is how
we would define this with a "vector":
<pre class="codesample">
defvector Hcp 4 3 2 1
</pre>

That's pretty simply.  Similarly, we can define a <span class="code">Controls</span> vector:
<pre class="codesample">
defvector Controls 2 1
</pre>
<p>
Once these vectors are defined, we can use them as functions anywhere
we used <span class="code">hcp</span> and <span class="code">controls</span>. 
<p>

Now, considering the following case: Your partner, north, opens a weak
two spades, and you have the agreement that partner always has a 6-card
suit with at least two of the top three honors.  You can define a vector:
<pre class="codesample">
defvector Top3 1 1 1
</pre>
Now, to test the quality of the spade suit, you could say:
<pre class="codesample">
if {[Top3 north spades]>=2} { ... }
</pre>
Pretty simple.
<p>
So you decide to write a "weak2" procedure:
<pre class="codesample">
defvector Top3 1 1 1

proc weak2 {hand suit} {
  if {[$suit $hand]==6 && [Top3 $hand $suit]>=2} { return 1 }
  return 0
}
</pre>
You can call this by saying:
<pre class="codesample">
#... 
main {
	if {[weak2 north spades]} { accept }
}
</pre>
This will deal out hands where north has exactly six
spades and two of the top three spades.
<p>
This works okay (although you have forgotten to restrict the other
suit lengths, so you could end up with voids and side 5-card or
6-card suits.)
<p>
Two weeks later, you and your partner decide that you will also
consider a suit worth a weak 2 if it contains three of the top
five cards, which, specifically, really means you've now allowed
suits led by <span class="code">QJT</span>, <span class="code">KJT</span>, and <span class="code">AJT</span>.  This is
not an uncommon agreement.
<p>
We could, of course, write a routine called "Top5" and check
both Top3 and Top5, but a little cleverness allows us to roll
this all up into one vector.
<pre class="codesample">
defvector weak2quality 2 2 2 1 1
</div>

You will see, if you think about it, that this vector evaluates
to 4 or more precisely when the suit has the right quality for
a weak two.  You then rewrite the weak2 function:
<p>
<pre class="codesample">
defvector weak2quality 2 2 2 1 1

proc weak2 {hand suit} {
  if {[$suit $hand]==6 && [weak2quality $hand $suit]>=4} { return 1 }
  return 0
}
</pre>

The advantage of the vector functions is that they can be computed
quickly, using table lookups.
<p>
However, vectors don't compute many additive functions, like "losers"
and "quick tricks," or even high card points with distribution adjustments.
For this, you will need to use the Deal 3.1 feature,
<a href="holding.html">holding functions.</a>  It pretty much
covers *all* such procedures, but still allows for a fast lookup.

<h2><a name="shapefunc">Shape functions and classes</a></h2>

In the <a href="quickstart.html">Introductory Tutorial</a>, we mentioned
the two functions, <span class="code">balanced</span>, and <span class="code">semi_balance</span>, and
called them "shape functions" because they take a hand name as an
argument, the return value depends only on the "shape" of the hand -
that is, on how many cards are in each suit.
<p>
In fact, <span class="code">balanced</span> and <span class="code">semi_balanced</span> are a special
sort of shape function, which we will call a "shape class."  A "shape
class" is a shape function which returns only the values 0 and 1,
and therefore defines a class of shapes, namely those shapes which
evaluate as 1.
<p>
<strong>Deal</strong> allows for extremely fast shape class and
shape function computations.
<p>
<h3> A basic shape class </h3>
For example, lets say that we want to write a shapeclass which
returns 1 if our hand is right shape for a one spade opening.  We would
do so with the following definition:
<pre class="codesample">
shapeclass spadeshape {
    if {$s>=5 && $s>=$h && $s>=$d && $s>=$c} { return 1}
    return 0
}
</pre>
This defines a routine, <span class="code">spadeshape</span>, which returns true
precisely when the hand has 5 or more spades and at least as
many spades as any other suit.
<p>
Notice, the variables <span class="code">$s</span>, <span class="code">$h</span>, <span class="code">$d</span>, and
<span class="code">$c</span>.  Consider it this way - when you pass a hand name to
a shape function, it sets these variables to the suit lengths,
and then evaluates the code.  <em> [ That is not how it works in
reality, because that would be too slow. ]</em>
<p>
The idiom, <span class="code">if {<em>expr</em>} {return 1}  return 0
</span> is so common in shape classes, <strong>Deal</strong> has
a shorthand, <span class="code">shapecond</span>, and we could have defined <span class="code">spadeshape</span>
as:
<pre class="codesample">
shapecond spadeshape {$s>=5 && $s>=$h && $s>=$d && $s>=$c}
</pre>
<h3> A sample shape function </h3>

Shape functions can return any string.  They can be extremely
powerful.
<p>
For example, we can define a function, <span class="code">opening_suit</span>:
<pre class="codesample">
shapefunc opening_suit {
	if {$c>$s && $c>$h && $c>$d} { return clubs }
	if {$d>$s && $d>$h && $d>$c} { return diamonds }
	if {$s>=5 && $s>=$h} { return spades }
	if {$h>=5} { return hearts }
	if {$d>=5 && $d>=$c} { return diamonds }
	if {$d>$c} { return diamonds }
	return clubs
}
</pre>
This function returns the name of the suit in which you should open 
open the hand (at least according to some people) in Standard American
bidding.
		
<p>
Recently, a number of people have mentioned to me Bergen's "rule of
20" for determining whether a hand is worth an opening bid. 
According to the rule, add your high card points to
the sum of the lengths of your longest two suits.  If that adds up to
20, open the hand.  We can write this as follows:
<pre class="codesample">
shapefunc bergen::shapeval {
    set p [lsort -integer -decreasing "$s $h $d $c"]
    set first [lindex "$p" 0]
    set second [lindex "$p" 1]
    expr $first+$second
}

proc bergen::opening {hand} {
    expr { [hcp $hand] + [bergen::shapeval $hand] >= 20}
}
</pre>
We can now use Bergen's rule in our simulations.
<p>
<h3> Calling shape functions explicitly </h3>

A shape function (or shape class) can be called with 4 numeric arguments:
<pre class="codesample">
set open3343 [openingsuit eval 3 3 4 3]
</pre>
This is most useful in defining shape classes and functions from
other shape classes and functions.  Assume you have shape classes
<span class="code">spadeshape</span> and <span class="code">heartshape</span> and you want to define
a new shape class, <span class="code">majorshape</span>.  You can do so as follows:
<pre class="codesample">
shapecond majorshape \
	{[spadeshape eval $s $h $d $c] || [heartshape eval $s $h $d $c]}
</pre>

<h2><a name="patternfunc">Pattern functions and classes</a></h2>
<p>In <strong>Deal 3.1.8</strong>, you have access to pattern functions and
classes, as well as shape functions and classes.</p>
<p>The pattern of a hand is the lengths of the suits in the hand, sorted
in descending order.</p>
<p>You could define the pattern class, "balanced," as:
<pre class="codesample">
patterncond balanced {$l1>3 && $l2>=3 && $l3>=3 && $l4>=2}
</pre>
<p>The variables <code>l1</code>, <code>l2</code>, <code>l3</code>, and <code>l4</code> are set to the lengths of the suits, <code>l1</code> being the longest,
<code>l4</code> the shortest.</p> [For clarification, the first characters of each of those variables is the lowercase letter L.]


<h2><a name="formatting">Customizable output formats</a></h2>

With verson 2.0 of <strong>Deal</strong>, it is finally possible to write
your own customizable format routines.
<p>
It is really fairly simple.  When <span class="code">Deal</span> accepts a hand,
it calls the procedure named <span class="code">write_deal</span>.  When it is finished
dealing the number of hands requested, it calls a procedure named 
<span class="code">flush_deal</span>.
<p>
To change the output format, we simply redefine these procedures.
Tcl does not mind such redefinitions.
<p>
For example, the formatter, <span class="code">format/none</span>, is just the code:
<pre class="codesample">
proc write_deal {} {
	# empty function
}
</pre>
By default, the <span class="code">flush_deal</span> procedure is already empty, so
we do not have to redefine it here.
<p>
Why might we need <span class="code">flush_deal</span> at all?  Some formatters
only write to output periodically. For example, <span class="code">format/practice</span>
writes files <span class="code">out.north</span>, <span class="code">out.east</span>, <span class="code">out.south</span>,
and <span class="code">out.west</span>.  The output in <span class="code">out.north</span> looks like:
<pre class="codesample">
                              north hands
============================================================================
     *1*                 *2*                 *3*                 *4*
  S 84                S T7                S QT3               S AJ9654
  H J8642             H Q65               H Q983              H K8
  D Q843              D KJ42              D 865               D J
  C 73                C T842              C AJ9               C K532

=============================================================================
</pre>
Clearly, therefore, <span class="code">write_deal</span> is buffering output
internally and only printing every fourth hand.  What happens when
the user requests 10 deals?  <span class="code">write_deal</span> will be called
on the tenth deal, but because the deal number is not a multiple
of four, <span class="code">write_deal</span> will not know to print the output.
The last two hands will be lost.
<p>
The solution is to make <strong>Deal</strong> call <span class="code">flush_deal</span>
on completion of dealing.
<h3> A most basic formatter - printing one hand </h3>

Here is a new formatter, which we will place in a file call <span class="code">NorthFmt</span>.
<pre class="codesample">
proc write_deal {} {
	puts "S: [north -void --- spades]"
	puts "H: [north -void --- hearts]"
	puts "D: [north -void --- diamonds]"
	puts "C: [north -void --- clubs]"
	puts "============================="
}
</pre>
Okay, what does this expression, 
<span class="code">[north&nbsp;-void&nbsp;---&nbsp;spades]</span>, do?
The expression <span class="code">[north&nbsp;spades]</span> returns the spade holding
of the north hand in a simple string form.  If the suit is void,
it returns the empty string.  The "<span class="code">-void ---</span>" in the
example above tells the formatter to use the string "<span class="code">---</span>" for
voids.
<p>
We could do this a little more easily:

<pre class="codesample">
proc write_deal {} {
    foreach char {S H D C} suit {spades hearts diamonds clubs} {
	puts "$char: [north -void --- $suit]"
    }
    puts "============================="
}
</pre>
This uses the interesting feature of the  Tcl <span class="code">foreach</span>
which lets two variables move through two lists.
<p>

The <span class="code">north</span> routine, without arguments, returns all four suits, in
a Tcl list format.  Here is a simple formatter for the north and south
hands:
<pre class="codesample">
proc write_deal {} {
    puts "{[north]} {[south]}"
}
</pre>
Yielding ugly output like:
<pre class="codesample">
{{J9654} {KQT832} {} {42}} {{7} {A74} {T763} {J9865}}
{{KT852} {Q} {KT83} {A83}} {{96} {AK7543} {Q96} {52}}
</pre>
Not pretty, but useful if piping to another Tcl program, because
Tcl programs will find this fairly easy to parse.
<p>
<h3><a name="stringbox">String boxes</a></h3>
For more complicated formats, I have added to Tcl an invention
of my own for string "drawings."  Tcl does not have any
decent formatting routines, other than the <span class="code">format</span>
command, which is based on the <span class="code">printf</span> class of functions
in C.  I've always found <span class="code">printf</span> a pain, even back in Fortran.
<p>
So I invented "string boxes."  A string box is a like a drawable
canvas, but for characters rather than pixels.  For example, here
is a slightly simpler version of the file <span class="code">format/okb</span>:
<pre class="codesample">
stringbox okbox 14 70
okbox write 4 15 "West"
okbox write 4 50 "East"
okbox write 0 30 "North"
okbox write 10 30 "South"
	...
</pre>
This code creates a string box named <span class="code">okbox</span> with 14 rows of
70 columns of text (initially all blank), and then writes
the words "West", "East", "North", and "South" in different locations
in that box.
<p>
Next we define the sub-boxes, one for each hand:
<pre class="codesample">
	...
okbox subbox okbox.north 0 36 4 15
okbox subbox okbox.south 10 36 4 15
okbox subbox okbox.east 5 50 4 15
okbox subbox okbox.west 5 15 4 15
	...
</pre>

A "subbox" is created from a parent box, and has both a row and column
location, and a row and column width.  In the above instance, all of
our sub-boxes are 4 rows and 15 columns, and placed in the location
where the hands will eventually be printed.
<p>
Our <span class="code">write_deal</span> procedure would look like:
<pre class="codesample">
proc write_deal {} {
  foreach hand {west south north east} {
    okputhand $hand
  }

  puts "[okbox]"
  puts "                       -----------------------------"
}

proc okputhand {hand} {

  okbox.$hand clear

  set rowhand 0
  foreach char {S H D C} suit {spades hearts diamonds clubs} {
    okbox.$hand write $rowhand 0 "$char [$hand -void --- $suit]"
    incr rowhand
  }
}
</pre>

<span class="code">write_deal</span> just calls the routine <span class="code">okputhand</span> for each 
hand, then writes out the contents of the entire string box, <span class="code">okbox</span>,
followed by the seperator string of hyphens.  Note that we convert
a string box to a normal string just by using its name alone, without
arguments, as in <span class="code">[okbox]</span>.  We can also convert a string with trailing
whitespace removed from lines, by saying <span class="code">[okbox compact]</span>. 
In fact, we probably should have used the <span class="code">compact</span> modifier,
since there is so much trailing white space in this format.
<p>
The <span class="code">okputhand</span> procedure first clears the sub-box associated 
that hand, then writes out the contents of the hand one suit at a time
to that same sub-box.
<p>
The output looks like:
<pre class="codesample">
                              North S KT6                             
                                    H J97                             
                                    D T8543                           
                                    C T5                              
               West                               East                
               S J75                              S Q983              
               H T86                              H A52               
               D AKJ7                             D Q9                
               C AQ8                              C KJ64

                                    H KQ43                            
                                    D 62

I have yet to put together complete documentation for string boxes,
but I intend to do so.  They have some remarkable features, and perhaps
some surprises for the unwary.
