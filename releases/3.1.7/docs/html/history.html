was originally conceived in 1988 for
bidding practice.  I was a math graduate student just learning
bridge and another grad student, Robin Pemantle, suggested a way to practice bidding.
His idea was to have the computer deal out twenty or so hands, and
then offer each hand up to you, randomly, for bidding.  This way,
you could bid all four hands in each of twenty deals, and, if you
tried hard, you could avoid remembering which hand was which.
<p>
I mentioned that idea to my partner at the time, Nathan Glasser,
and he wrote a program called <strong>bid</strong>, which is still
<a href="http://rgb.anu.edu.au/Bridge/Programmes/Bid-BridgeBidder/">
available from the bridge archives.</a>
<p>
The problem with <strong>bid</strong> was that it could not
be used for practicing specific auctions.  John Oswalt solved
this in a rather crude fashion. His modification  forced you to re-link
your application each time you wrote a new query (in C). 
<!-- [ John Oswalt
has written a <a href="http://www.jao.com/java/bid/">Java version of Bid
which is kind of fun.</a>] -->
<p>
After using this modified version for a while, I got frustrated and
wrote a <em>very</em> crude interpreter. It was a "stack-based" language
so I wouldn't have to write a parser.  It was very much like the Unix "dc"
calculator, only without all the features.  (That's a joke, but I guess
you wouldn't get it if you didn't know <code>dc</code>.)
<p>
I could have used a fully interpreted language, like Perl, but for
the types of simulations I was doing, I need very fast execution
of the computation routines, and so implementing the core in an
interpreted language was going to slow down the program too much.
<p>
In about 1992 I first stumble across the Tcl language.  Immediately,
I saw that I could use it in my dealer.  Tcl was an interpreted
language which had excellent support for extensibility via fast
C routines.  It turned out that Nathan's
code did not easily fit into my new scheme, so I rewrote the dealer
from scratch.  I had my first version done quickly, and released the
first public version (v0.5 I called it, in retrospect) in 1993.  I announced it on rec.games.bridge in <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/rec.games.bridge/browse_thread/thread/da3af252d9a4dd5a/a0394c4aa92908fe">this post.</a>
<p>
The next version (v1.0) was released about two years later, and basically
cleaned up the query interface.  In the haze of my memory, I can not
recall what features were added, certainly "vectors" and "shape classes."
<p>
Version 2.0 uses new optimization methods, some of which
were suggested to me by the very same Nathan Glasser.  There are some
other new features, including <em>shape functions</em>, <em>customizable
output formatting</em>, and more built-in formats.
<p>
Version 3.0 was the next major release. Major changes were:
<ul>
<li> GNU GPL license - making it free for all use
<li> Much faster execution using Tcl 8.x features.
<li> Addition of 'holding functions' - like 'vectors' but more suitable
for complex evaluations like "losers" and "CCCC."
<li> "Smart stacking" for finding rare hands.
</ul>
<p>Deal got mentioned in the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/22/crosswords/bridge/22card.html?pagewanted=print">New York Times bridge column.</a></p>
<p>
Version 3.1 was release in 2008, with Bo Haglund's double dummy solver built in, so you can call a 'deal::tricks' function to get double dummy data.
<p>Starting with release 3.1.6, the source code is hosted at <a href="http://andrews-deal.googlecode.com/">Google Code.</a>
<!--
<p>
The next version of Deal I've called "<em>iDeal.</em>"
It's a much changed beast, and could almost be called a general bridge
programming environment.  Currently, my progress here has stalled, but
I'm planning on a GUI interface to the Deal.

<p>
While <strong>Deal</strong> is a labor of love for me, it makes it easier
to love the project if I get feedback which shows people are using <strong>
Deal</strong>.  Even if you tried <strong>Deal</strong> and did not like
it, please let me know.
