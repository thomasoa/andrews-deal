<h2>Performance Improvements</h2>
There are a number of performance improvements in <strong>Deal 3.1.</strong>

<h3>Tcl 8.x Improvements</h3>
In early releases of Tcl (7.x and earlier) the interpreter treated
everything as a string.  That meant that Tcl data and procedures were
regularly parsed and reparsed, which made it a fairly slow language.
Tcl 8.x changed that - it uses
internal objects which have optional string representations.
<p>
This means that the first time you pass the string "AK4" to a
<strong>Deal</strong> procedure, it will parse it into an
internal represention, and then never parses it again.  The
internals of <strong>Deal</strong> now take advantage of this
in quite a lot of places.
<a name="holdingProc"></a>
<h3>Fast and general holding procedures</h3>
Many bridge evaluators can be seen as evaluating the holdings
in each suit, and then adding up the values.  For example,
in the hand:  
<blockquote><pre>
  Spades: AKx
  Hearts: KQJ
Diamonds: xxxx
   Clubs: Axx
</pre></blockquote>
We compute the high card points as 7, 6, 0, and 4, in spades, hearts,
diamonds, and clubs, for a total of 17 points.  We compute losers
in the suits as 1, 1, 3, and 2, for a total of 7 losers.
<p>
In Deal 2.0, you could define a very limited set of procedures of this
sort - the so-called <a href="advanced.html#vector">vector procedures.</a>
You could, for example, define "high card points" or "controls," but
not "losers."
<p>
In Deal 3.1, virtually any such procedure can be written.
<p>
See <a href="holding.html">seperate document</a> for more details.

<h2>Other Features</h2>
<h3>GIB interfaces</h3>

Deal 3.1 now has a a set of tools for people who own
<a href="http://www.gibware.com/">GIB</a>.  Specifically,
it provides a procedure for determing the number of tricks
available on a deal, double dummy.
<p>
See <a href="GIBstuff.html">separate document</a> for details.
<h3>Input formats</h3>
<strong>Deal 3.1</strong> now lets you read deals from a file easily.  It is
also easy to write extensions which change the way <strong>Deal 3.1</strong>
reads from files or generates deals.  
<p>
To access an input format, you can either add the line:
<blockquote><pre>
deal::input <em>formatName</em> [<em>args...</em>]
</pre></blockquote>
or, from the command line, use the <code>-I</code> switch:
<blockquote><pre>
deal -I "<em>FormatName</em>[ <em>args...</em>]" ...
</pre></blockquote>
<strong>Deal 3.1</strong> includes the following input formats:
<dl>
<dt><code>line</code>
<dd>This reads in deals in the format written by deal with the <code>-l</code>
flag.  For example, you can generate a file of 1000 deals then run two
seperate queries on the file with:
<blockquote><pre>
deal -l 1000 > sample.txt
deal -I "line sample.txt" -i query1.tcl > out1.txt
deal -I "line sample.txt" -i query2.tcl > out2.txt
</pre></blockquote>
If no file is given, the lines are read from standard input.
<p>
<dt><code>giblib</code>
<dd>Matt Ginsberg has made available a large file of 700,000+ deals
with double dummy data.  This input format lets read this data
file sequentially.  Calls to the GIB procedure <code>gib::tricks</code>
take the data from this file, rather than calling the double-dummy
solver.
<blockquote><pre>
deal::input giblib [<em>filename</em>]
</pre></blockquote>

If no file is given, <strong>Deal</strong> looks in the
current directory for a file named <code>library.dat</code>.
<p>
<em>The data file is not included in this release - it's really huge.</em>
See <a href="http://www.cirl.uoregon.edu/ginsberg/gibresearch.html">the
GIB research project page</a> for more details.
<dt><code>smartstack</code>
<dd>The deal of the <code>smartstack</code> is to find certain rare
types of deals very quickly, not using the standard dealing techniques,
but using a more complicated and data-heavy approach.
<a href="#smartstack"><code>Smart stacking</code></a> is documented
seperately below.
</dl>
To add a new input format named Foo, you write a file named
<code>input/Foo.tcl</code> which contains a Tcl package named Foo
with procedures called <code>set_input</code> and <code>next</code>.
See the input formats included with <strong>Deal</strong> for examples.
The <code>next</code> procedure should return an error when it has
reached the end of input.
<p>
An input format does not have to read from a file.  For example,
the <code>smartstack</code> code is a factory which builds deals
on the fly with one hand fitting a certain condition.
<a name="smartstack"></a>
<h3>Smart Stacking</h3>
Deal, by default, just keeps dealing hands until it finds one that
fits a pattern.  This can be too slow sometimes when looking for
specific hands.
<p>
Suppose we want north to have a balanced hand with 22 or 23 high card
points. We can force this
by using the <code>smartstack</code> input format:
<blockquote><pre>
deal::input smartstack north balanced hcp 22 23
</pre></blockquote>
The arguments tell the stacker to randomly build north hands that
are balanced with high card points in the range of 22 and 23.
<p>
Any shape class can be used in the place of <code>balanced</code>,
and any holding procedure can be used in place of <code>hcp</code>
in the above example.  If an evaluator is not passed in, there
is no range requirement.  If you wish no shape restrictions,
use the shapeclass <code>AnyShape</code>.
<p>
Specific cards can still be placed in specific hands:
<blockquote><pre>
        deal::input smartstack north balanced hcp {20 21}
	south is K52 KJ3 98542 AK
        north gets AS QS QH
</pre></blockquote>
Smart stacking can also put restrictions on specific suits:

<blockquote><pre>
deal::input smartstack north balanced hcp 20 21
smartstack::holding diamonds controls 2 3
</pre></blockquote>
This requires north to have 2-3 controls in diamonds.
<p>
The tighter the restrictions, the faster <strong>Deal</strong>
will be able to build hands which satisfy them.
<p>
Any additional conditions you want to place on any of the hands can
still be placed in <code>main</code>, as usual.
<h4>Performance issues</h4>
Smart stacking costs a lot of initial overhead.  For example, on
my Linux computer, <code>ex/1-shapeclass.tcl</code> in the release
has no startup
time, and takes about 0.014 seconds per match found.  The equivalent
script using <code>smartstack</code>, <code>ex/1-stack.tcl</code>,
takes almost 13 seconds at startup
time, but then takes onlu 0.002 seconds per match found.  So
if I'm generating 10,000 with these deals, it takes about
36 with smart stacking, and about 140 seconds without.  But if
I'm generating 1,000, they take about the same time, and if I'm generating
only 10, using smart stacking is costly.
<p>
Is smart stacking ever useful when dealing with small sample requests?
Definitely - if the hand is *very* specific and/or rare.  For example,
the two above scripts use a point range of 11-15, but if they are
changed to seek 21-22 hcp hands of the same shape, they both take about 10
seconds to find 10 deals, but the smart stacker takes only 14 seconds
to find 1,000, while the standard algorithm takes 1,000 second!
<p>
Originally, I was going to call the "smart stacker" by the name,
"deal factory."  Like a real world factory, there is a large startup
cost, but after it is built, it builds deals to specification far
faster.  The more specific your needs and/or the larger supply you
need, the more useful that initial investment is.
<p>
If I use smartstack to generate balanced hands with 20 points, it has
a startup time of about 20 seconds.  If I request balanced 25-counts,
17 seconds, balanced 29-counts 12 seconds.  After startup, the amount
of time to find examples is almost nil.  Without smartstack, it takes
about five minutes to generate ten examples of balanced 29-counts.
With smartstack, only 13 seconds.
<p>
For the evaluator, don't use one that has too many possible values,
or the size of the stacker's table balloons horribly. 
For example, in each suit, the values possible for <code>hcp</code> are
0-10.  But if you were to use something really complex with floating
point values, you might screw the pooch.  No smart checking is applied
when building the table, either, so <em>Deal</em> might just appear to churn.
