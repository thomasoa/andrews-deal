# Better/Easier Statistical Analysis #

One feature of **Deal** that many users have been requesting is better statistical analysis tools and documentation.  I'd like to make it easier to do simple statistical analysis of accepted deals in the simulation.

# Graphical User Interface #

This is the most requested feature.  The problem is, GUI programming is hard, especially with a tool as flexible as **Deal**. Basically, it's not a 'feature,' but an entirely new project.
