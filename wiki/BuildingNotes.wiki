= Building from the Google Code =

My primary build computers are Macintoshes, so the Makefile is somewhat Mac-centric.  You will have to figure out how to change the Makefile yourself for Linux builds.

== Building on OS X ==

You need the Apple Developer Tools installed.

After checking out the code, just create an empty file, "Make.dep" in the top directory and then run 'make.'  It should just work.

== Building on Ubuntu ==

You will need 'g++' and 'tcl-dev' packages installed.

{{{
$ sudo apt-get install tcl8.5-dev
$ sudo apt-get install g++
}}}

Edit the Makefile so the it include Make.ubuntu file.

Create an empty file, Make.dep.

If you installed another version of Tcl (say, 8.3) change the line in Make.ubuntu to read:
{{{
TCL_VERSION=8.3
}}}

== Building on Windows ==

You are on your own here, sorry.
