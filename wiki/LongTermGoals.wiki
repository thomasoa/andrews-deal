= Better/Easier Statistical Analysis =

One feature of *Deal* that many users have been requesting is better statistical analysis tools and documentation.  I'd like to make it easier to do simple statistical analysis of accepted deals in the simulation.

= Graphical User Interface =

This is the most requested feature.  The problem is, GUI programming is hard, especially with a tool as flexible as *Deal*. Basically, it's not a 'feature,' but an entirely new project.
