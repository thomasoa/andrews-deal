= Getting the Source Code with SVN =

Google Code uses the Subversion version control system.  This lets programmers keep track of the changes they've made to code over time.

Assuming you know how to use subversion, you can get various versions of the source code.  

== The Latest Release ==
{{{
    http://andrews-deal.googlecode.com/svn/release/latest
}}}

== Older Releases ==

If you want an older version, you can checkout out the [http://code.google.com/p/andrews-deal/source/browse/release/ list of available versions] and then checkout the version you would like.  For example, to check out version 3.1.5, you could check out:
{{{
    http://andrews-deal.googlecode.com/svn/release/v3-1-5
}}}

== The Latest Code ==

The very latest code, not released, can be gotten by checking out the trunk:
